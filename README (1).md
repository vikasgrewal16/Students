# Students - BeyondExam

Students, a ThinkBeyondExams intern team aims to explore the content world which is basically a face to the users of ThinkBeyondExam website in which we are exploring what we can learn and make our learning journeys enjoyable by creating some small small projects about our intrests and uploading the same syllabus and same website or assignments from which we are learning to the ThinkBeyondExams website server which helps students like us to create there journey enjoyable and informative by watching our journey and syllabus freely.


## Acknowledgements

Bearing in mind we are using this opportunity to express my deepest gratitude and special thanks to Mr Pankaj Baranwal who in spite of being extraordinarily busy with her/his duties, took time out to hear, guide and keep us on the correct path and allowing us to carry out our project at their esteemed organization.

## How much we have implemented and will be implementing
We have made almost half half courses of each domain and we are interacting with students to create a learning journey with us. So far we have one student who is excited to create his journey with us \.

## Problem Faced
Till now we have not so much big problem facing but one problem that we want to issue that importing a playlist with a large no of video(more than 50) order of video have been changed automatically and also we do not have any option to correct them. Also one more issue was that after importing we have to refresh 5-6 times so processing takes a lot of time.
